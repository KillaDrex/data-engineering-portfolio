## Key Learnings & Tradeoffs

- **What worked well**  
  For example, leveraging cloud-native services streamlined deployment and reduced local config errors.

- **What was challenging**  
  Managing IAM permissions for cross-service integration introduced unexpected complexity.

- **Tradeoffs made**  
  Chose ECS over Kubernetes to reduce infrastructure overhead, at the cost of some scalability and control.
