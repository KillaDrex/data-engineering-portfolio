# 👋 Introduction

Hi, I'm Andre A. Aquino. As of now I'm currently studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in Mapua University, Philippines.
I have a keen intererest in analytics, data processing, and information management.  
I'm currently preparing to launch my career in data engineering, where I can build efficient pipelines and scalable solutions.

## 🎯 Goal

To further my studies and showcase my talents, I devised a six-week timeline to complete at least three (3) data engineering projects.
Each project will highlight proper documentation, technical proficiency, and structured problem-solving. I believe this
will reflect my learning journey and my commitment to building real-world solutions.

This is all based on Google's Data Engineering Learning Path. I selected the most
high-impact courses, and from there I'll utilize learned skills for certain
problems. Here's the link if you want to check it out:

## 🛤️ Roadmap

### Week 1: Planning & Setup
- Setup GitHub portfolio repository
- Research relevant datasets and prepare sample problem statements for projects
- Prepare diagram templates
- Work on foundational courses 

### Week 2: Project 1 – Batch Pipeline Project

### Week 3: Project 2 – Streaming Pipeline Project

### Week 4: Project 3 – Serverless Data Flow Project

### Week 5: Projects Overhaul & Project 4

### Week 6: Wrap-up

I'm also trying to learn more about Git as I'm familiar with it but without any
systematic learning, and I don't use it enough as well. I've devised a journal
for that: [My Git Journal](git-journal.md)
